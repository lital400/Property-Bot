# Property-Bot

As part of a directed independent study at UNF, I had to research some real estate properties (1,007 entries, to be exact). 
Instead of doing it manually, I built my first bot that would open a broswer, go to a local Property Appraiser website, 
search each address, and retrieve the required property information. The data is then saved as a csv file.
